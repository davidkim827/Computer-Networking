# Computer Networking

<b><i>Use of any code in this repo in any form for academic purposes is considered cheating, which is not only unfair to your classmates, but as well as yourself. Use at your own risk.</i></b>

This is a repository of work that was completed for the Networking class. All work culminated in creating a network from bottom up utilizing Quagga's vtysh interface. Manual assignments of IP addresses, allowing for OSPF among the different areas of the network, creating a DHCP server, socket communication, as well as a rudimentary DNS for communication amongst the different machines/routers was created to display a working knowledge of networks.

Screenshots were captured of the work, as all the work was done via virtual machines.
