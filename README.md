# Computer Networking

This is a repository of work that was completed for the Networking class. All work culminated in creating a network from bottom up utilizing Quagga's vtysh interface. Manual assignments of IP addresses, allowing for OSPF among the different areas of the network, creating a DHCP server, socket communication, as well as a rudimentary DNS for communication amongst the different machines/routers was created to display a working knowledge of networks.

Screenshots were captured of the work, as all the work was done via virtual machines.
